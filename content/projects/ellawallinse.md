[Ella Wallin](https://ellawallin.se) is an illustrator and concept artist graduated from Vancouver Film School. In close coordination, I designed and developed her portfolio website.

## Process

We started by collecting inspiration from other artists' websites, noting what we liked and what worked well. We went ahead with sketching, and then I made some parallel wireframes:

## Insights

It's been a great learning opportunity in working with a client: discussing requirements, presenting multiple designs, and combining her preferences with my design judgement.
